# Introduction

LootiScript is a dynamic scripting language designed specifically for game development with the **L8B** engine. Inspired by Lua, it offers a familiar syntax while introducing modern features and optimizations tailored for real-time applications.

## Key Features

- **Familiar Syntax**: Easy to learn for anyone familiar with Lua or JavaScript.
- **Game-Focused**: Built-in support for common game development patterns.
- **High Performance**: Compiled to bytecode and executed by a custom VM with inline caching.
- **Safe Execution**: No runtime errors for undefined variables or properties.

## Core Principles

### 1. No Null or Undefined
In LootiScript, there is no `null`, `nil`, or `undefined`. Variables that haven't been assigned a value default to `0`. This eliminates a whole class of common runtime errors found in other languages.

```lua
// Unassigned variables are 0
local x
Console.log(x)  // Output: 0
```

### 2. Simplified Booleans
There is no special boolean type. The rule is simple:
- `0` is **false**
- Everything else is **true**

```lua
if 0 then
  print("This won't run")
else
  print("0 is false")
end

if 1 then
  print("1 is true")
end
```

### 3. Global by Default
Variables are global unless declared with `local`. This is similar to Lua and allows for easy sharing of state, but you should use `local` for better performance and scope management.

```lua
score = 100        // Global variable
local health = 50  // Local variable
```

## Why LootiScript?

LootiScript bridges the gap between ease of use and performance. It allows you to write game logic quickly without worrying about memory management or complex type systems, while still running fast enough for 60 FPS gameplay.
