# Control Flow

Control flow statements allow you to dictate how your code executes based on conditions and loops.

## Conditional Statements

### If-Else
Use `if`, `elseif`, and `else` to execute code based on conditions.

```lua
local score = 75

if score >= 90 then
  print("Rank: A")
elseif score >= 70 then
  print("Rank: B")
else
  print("Rank: C")
end
```

Remember that in LootiScript:
- `0` is **false**
- Everything else is **true**

```lua
if 0 then
  // This block will NOT run
end

if 1 then
  // This block WILL run
end
```

## Loops

### While Loop
Executes a block of code as long as the condition is true.

```lua
local i = 0
while i < 5 do
  print(i)
  i += 1
end
```

### For Loop (Numeric)
Iterates from a start value to an end value.

```lua
// Syntax: for variable = start to end [by step] do ... end

// Count from 1 to 5
for i = 1 to 5 do
  print(i)
end

// Count from 0 to 10 by 2
for i = 0 to 10 by 2 do
  print(i)  // 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
end

// Count down
for i = 10 to 1 by -1 do
  print(i)
end
```

### For-In Loop
Iterates over elements of a list or keys of an object.

```lua
// Iterating over a list
local fruits = {"apple", "banana", "orange"}

for fruit in fruits do
  print(fruit)
end

// Iterating over an object
local player = object
  name = "Hero",
  level = 5
end

for key in player do
  print(key .. ": " .. player[key])
end
```

## Loop Control

### Break
Use `break` to exit a loop prematurely.

```lua
for i = 1 to 10 do
  if i == 5 then
    break
  end
  print(i)
end
// Prints 1, 2, 3, 4
```

### Continue
Use `continue` to skip the rest of the current iteration and proceed to the next one.

```lua
for i = 1 to 5 do
  if i == 3 then
    continue
  end
  print(i)
end
// Prints 1, 2, 4, 5
```
