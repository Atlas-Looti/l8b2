# Classes

Classes provide a way to create reusable object templates with shared behavior. LootiScript supports class-based object-oriented programming with inheritance.

## Defining a Class

Use the `class` keyword to define a new class.

```lua
class Player
  // Constructor is called when creating a new instance
  constructor = function(self, name)
    self.name = name
    self.health = 100
  end

  // Method definition
  takeDamage = function(self, amount)
    self.health -= amount
    print(self.name .. " took " .. amount .. " damage")
  end
end
```

## Creating Instances

Use the `new` keyword to create an instance of a class.

```lua
local p1 = new Player("Hero")
p1.takeDamage(10)
// Output: Hero took 10 damage
```

## Inheritance

Classes can inherit from other classes using the `extends` keyword.

```lua
class Enemy extends Player
  constructor = function(self, name, type)
    // Call parent constructor
    super(name)
    self.type = type
  end

  attack = function(self)
    print(self.name .. " attacks!")
  end
end

local goblin = new Enemy("Goblin", "Melee")
goblin.takeDamage(5)  // Inherited method
goblin.attack()       // New method
```

## `this` vs `self`

In LootiScript methods, the first parameter is conventionally named `self`, which refers to the instance. However, you can also use `this` keyword inside methods to refer to the current instance, similar to other languages.

```lua
class Counter
  count = 0

  increment = function()
    this.count += 1  // 'this' refers to the instance
  end
end
```

## Static Members

You can define static members by adding them directly to the class object after definition.

```lua
class MathHelper
  // ...
end

MathHelper.PI = 3.14159
MathHelper.square = x => x * x

print(MathHelper.square(5)) // 25
```
