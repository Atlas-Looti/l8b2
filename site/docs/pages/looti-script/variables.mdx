# Variables

Variables are containers for storing data values. In LootiScript, variables are dynamically typed, meaning they can hold any type of data and can change type during execution.

## Declaration & Assignment

You don't need to declare variables before using them. Assigning a value to a name automatically creates the variable.

```lua
// Assignment
score = 100
name = "Player 1"
isActive = 1
```

### Default Value
All variables that haven't been assigned a value are automatically `0`. You will never encounter an "undefined variable" error.

```lua
// Using an unassigned variable
total = score + bonus  // If bonus is not defined, it is 0
// total becomes 100 + 0 = 100
```

## Scope

### Global Variables
By default, variables are **global**. This means they can be accessed from anywhere in your code, including inside functions and other files.

```lua
// Global variable
playerScore = 0

function addScore(points)
  // Accessing global variable
  playerScore += points
end
```

### Local Variables
Use the `local` keyword to create variables that are only accessible within the current block (chunk, function, or control structure). This is recommended for temporary values to avoid polluting the global namespace and for better performance.

```lua
function calculateDamage(base)
  // Local variable, only exists inside this function
  local multiplier = 2
  return base * multiplier
end

// multiplier is not accessible here
// print(multiplier) -> would print 0
```

#### Alternative Keywords
LootiScript also supports `var` and `let` as aliases for `local`. These work exactly the same way:

```lua
function example()
  var x = 10    // Same as: local x = 10
  let y = 20    // Same as: local y = 20
  local z = 30  // Standard way
end
```

All three keywords (`local`, `var`, `let`) create local variables with the same behavior. Use whichever you prefer, though `local` is the most common.

## Variable Naming
Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but must not start with a number. They are case-sensitive.

- **Valid**: `score`, `player1`, `_internal`, `camelCase`
- **Invalid**: `1player`, `if` (reserved keyword), `break`

## Best Practices

1. **Prefer Local Variables**: Use `local` whenever possible. Accessing local variables is faster than global variables.
2. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive names like `enemyHealth` instead of `h`.
3. **Constants**: For values that don't change, consider using uppercase names (convention only) to indicate they are constants, e.g., `MAX_SPEED = 10`.

```lua
// Good practice
local MAX_LIVES = 3
local currentLives = MAX_LIVES

function takeDamage()
  currentLives -= 1
  if currentLives <= 0 then
    gameOver()
  end
end
```
