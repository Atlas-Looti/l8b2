# Introduction

## What is L8B?

L8B is a 2D game engine for building interactive and dynamic game experiences.

L8B supports sprite systems, animations, collisions, audio, and level design in one integrated workflow. The engine gives you full control in designing game flow, game logic, and visual presentation in a structured and efficient way.

L8B is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and expressive—perfect for rapid prototyping as well as full-scale 2D game production.

## What is it used for?

With L8B you can create 2D games like platformers, RPGs, puzzles, or other interactive experiences with sprite systems, animations, collisions, audio, and gameplay logic all handled by the engine.

## Key Features

- **LootiScript Language**: A lightweight scripting language inspired by Lua, compiled to bytecode for high performance
- **2D Rendering**: Full-featured 2D rendering system with sprites, maps, text, and primitives
- **Audio System**: Sound effects, music, and procedural beep generation
- **Input Handling**: Keyboard, mouse, touch, and gamepad support
- **Scene Management**: URL-based routing and scene lifecycle management
- **Asset Management**: Load images, fonts, JSON, text files, and more
- **Storage**: Persistent data storage using localStorage
- **Hot Reload**: Development server with hot module replacement
- **TypeScript/JavaScript Runtime**: Full TypeScript support for engine development

## Getting Started

1. **Install L8B CLI**:

   ```bash
   pnpm add l8b --save-dev
   ```

2. **Create a new project**:

   ```bash
   l8b init my-game
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
