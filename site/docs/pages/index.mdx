# Introduction

## What is L8B?

L8B is a 2D game engine for building interactive and dynamic game experiences.

L8B supports sprite systems, animations, collisions, audio, and level design in one integrated workflow. The engine gives you full control in designing game flow, game logic, and visual presentation in a structured and efficient way.

L8B is designed to be lightweight, flexible, and expressive—perfect for rapid prototyping as well as full-scale 2D game production.

## What is it used for?

L8B is a 2D game engine & Web3-engine all-in-one—ideal for building games or Web3-based applications that can run directly as mini-apps in Farcaster, Base App, and similar Web3 clients.

With L8B you can create 2D games like platformers, RPGs, puzzles, or token/NFT-based games with sprite systems, animations, collisions, audio, and gameplay logic all handled by the engine.

Because it supports integration with Farcaster Mini Apps and Base App, your game or application can run as a mini-app on-chain: users can interact, sign transactions, use on-chain wallets, leverage Farcaster identity, without needing to install a separate application.

Perfect for building Web3 products like:

- peer-to-peer games
- web-games with token/NFT utilities
- social mini-apps
- on-chain marketplaces
- blockchain + game experiments with built-in social distribution

This engine + Web3 stack makes it easier to go from idea → prototype → live app/mini-app while leveraging the social and crypto wallet features already available in the ecosystem.

L8B is not just a 2D game engine; it's a bridge between 2D gameplay, on-chain interactions, and distribution in the Web3 ecosystem.
